This semester, we covered a wide variety of statistical training techniques, working to manipulate, visualize, and interpret patterns seen commonly in biological data. For the most part, we primarily used statistical computing language R through Rstudio. In the last part of the course, we shifted toward analyzing text and string-type data using regular expressions, leading to sequence alignment and other related material. Here, we shifted to Python to achieve similar analytic goals. 

In this code below, we mess around with the re.findall() function in python. This returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. 

Using re.findall(), we can match all IP addressses in this string (string2).
