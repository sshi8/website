      <description>My name is Sophie Shi, a fourth year Pre-Dental Biology undergraduate student at The University of Texas at Austin. To feed my growing interest in biology, I currently work in the Matouschek Lab where we explore the Ubiquitin-Proteasome system. I also love being a volunteer at UT Informal Classes Aimed at Adults with Intelectual and Developmental Disabilities. When I am not studying or in the lab, you can probably find me getting a great workout in, walking around at the farmerâ€™s market, or making a watercolor painting!</description>
