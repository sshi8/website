My name is Sophie Shi, a fourth year Pre-Dental Biology undergraduate student at The University of Texas at Austin. To feed my growing interest in biology, I currently work in the Matouschek Lab where we explore the Ubiquitin-Proteasome system. I also love being a volunteer at UT Informal Classes Aimed at Adults with Intelectual and Developmental Disabilities. When I am not studying or in the lab, you can probably find me getting a great workout in, walking around at the farmerâ€™s market, or making a watercolor painting! If you have any questions for me, feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:sophiashi@utexas.edu">email</a>.</p>
